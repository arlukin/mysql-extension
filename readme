Fareoffice Language
===================

Used to save multiple translations of a text in one mysql column.

This is very useful if you have an existing database model which stores texts
that you in a later stage want to translate to different languages. With this
plugin module, you will not need to redesign your database model. It's also
useful if you don't want a "cluttered" database model where "every" table
has a relation to your translation tables.

The texts are loaded from and saved to the database with two UDF functions,
getLanguage and setLanguage.

        INSERT INTO foLanguageTest
            (id, description)
        VALUES
            (1, setLanguage(NULL, "Sverige", "SE_", ""));

        UPDATE
            foLanguageTest
        SET
            description = setLanguage(description, "England", "UK_", "FI_")
        WHERE
            id = 1;

        SELECT
            getLanguage(description, "FI_", "UK_", 1)
        FROM
            foLanguageTest';
