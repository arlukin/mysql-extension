foLanguage
==========

Used to save multiple translations of a text in one mysql column.

This is very useful if you have an existing database model which stores texts
that you in a later stage want to translate to different languages. With this
plugin module, you will not need to redesign your database model. It's also
useful if you don't want a "cluttered" database modell where "every" table
has a relation to your translation tables.

The texts are loaded from and saved to the database with two UDF functions,
getLanguage and setLanguage.
